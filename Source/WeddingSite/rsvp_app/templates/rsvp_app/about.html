        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our story on the surface isn't too much different from most love stories. Girl meets boy, girl tolerates boy, boy asks girl on a date to eat mediterranean food and go rock climbing. Badda bing, badda boom, they fall in love. To see what's unique about this story though we need to go back further. You see, Carter and Sarah were made for each other, and to understand how we need to know more about where they come from. Carter was born in 1992, and despite his immense displeasure spent the majority of his early years being dressed in leotards and tutus by his older sisters, adding in his own flare by wearing a shiny blue bike helmet to accent the sequins in the tutus. He would run around his neighborhood with his friends (and his helmet still on) collecting rocks and catching cool bugs. Sarah, born in 1994, was a curly haired fire cracker as a young girl. In Texas, she spent her childhood catching lizards, running her neighborhood lemonade stand and playing rugby with her brothers. From a young age both Carter and Sarah had adventurous spirits, which only grew as they got older. Most importantly they  learned to love others, and the great joy that came from that. It is the shared desire to live meaningful lives full of love and adventure that made the pair so sure that they wanted to spend the rest of their days together. So now you can see why for them it was simple, and how they always knew that they were meant to be! </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Bride: Sarah Thompson</h2>
        <p class="lead">Sarah is a senior at the University of Oklahoma studying International Business, Supply Chain Management and Spanish. She will graduate in May and has accepted a job to start after the couple's honeymoon. Outside of school she has a passion for art which she applies through painting and graphic design. Her art is mostly inspired by vivid colors and designs from different places she has visited, with her most favorite being Turkey for its ornate mosques in Istanbul and beautiful scenery of Cappadocia (pictured here!). </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Groom: Carter Fawson</h2>
        <p class="lead">Carter just graduated from Utah State University in Management Information Systems. Which is just a boring way of saying that he got a degree in computers and business. Before school he spent two years in the Tongan islands in the South Pacific as a missionary for his church. In his freetime he likes to program, ski, hike, go camping, and basically do anything outside. He loves traveling, especially to beautiful places in the great outdoors. His favorite place is the Windriver Range in Wyoming (also pictured here!). Carter also accepted a job to start in June and in addition he is in the works of starting a web design business.</p>
